#This is a exercise in programming in Rust.

## Purpose
The program will create an HTML table that can be imported into a larger project or in Mailchimp.  Input is provided by terminal or via a CSV file.

## Challenges

Other than having to learn Rust from scratch, I had to understand how to select File vs StdOut as well as File vs terminal.

## ToDo

I still would like to see if it is possible to allow piping ("|") into the command without any command line argument which by default would also use the CSV method.
